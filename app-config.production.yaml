app:
  # Should be the same as backend.baseUrl when using the `app-backend` plugin.
  baseUrl: https://backstage-carbon.onrender.com

backend:
  # Note that the baseUrl should be the URL that the browser and other clients
  # should use when communicating with the backend, i.e. it needs to be
  # reachable not just from within the backend host, but from all of your
  # callers. When its value is "http://localhost:7007", it's strictly private
  # and can't be reached by others.
  baseUrl: https://backstage-carbon.onrender.com
  # The listener can also be expressed as a single <host>:<port> string. In this case we bind to
  # all interfaces, the most permissive setting. The right value depends on your specific deployment.
  listen: ':7007'
